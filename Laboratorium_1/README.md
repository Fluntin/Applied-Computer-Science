# Laboration 1: Repetition

Write your own class that represents a Pokémon.
The class should have an attribute for each property in the table.
The class should have at least five methods, including these three. You can choose the remaining methods yourself!
- `__init__`
- `__str__`
- `__lt__`

Write a function that creates a Pokémon object (create your own test data) and calls the methods to ensure they work as intended.

Then, write a function that:
- Reads all the rows from the file.
- Creates objects.
- Stores the objects in a list (Python's `list()`).
- Returns the list.

Also, write a function to search for a Pokémon in the list.

Finally, test that the program works correctly.
